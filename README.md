# Predicting Merge Conflicts using Deep Learning

Perform the prediction on merge conflicts using deep learning algorithms (Deep Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit). Two different methodologies were used for considering the variables:

* First all variables considered for the merge conflicts prediction.
* Second, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to group the variable by removing the overfitting and multicollinearity. Furthermore, PCA group variables are used for the prediction of merge conflicts.

## Point for running the code:
* Every function is written in main.py, just need to run this script.
* To run the files 'PCA.R' and 'ROSE_DIT.R',  need to run the script in R.
